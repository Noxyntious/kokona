# Kokona
a multipurpose simple text editor written with egui and rust.

## current features
- editing text
- file open/save/close

## planned features
- ctrl+f searching!!! - added in upstream and upcoming 0.2
- syntax highlighting
- tabs (maybe)
- directory tree (also maybe)

## buggies (inevitable)
- line and col counters are a little wonky
- save doesnt work (must use save as) - fixed in upstream and upcoming 0.2
