a multipurpose simple text editor written with egui and rust.

## current features
- editing text
- file open/save/close
- search

## planned features
- syntax highlighting
- tabs (maybe)
- directory tree (also maybe)

## buggies (inevitable)
- line and col counters are a little wonky

## install
download from releases or use "cargo install --git" to install from upstream

### why is it called "Kokona"?
